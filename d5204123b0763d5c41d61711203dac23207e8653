      "message": "I\u0027m assuming you mean if there legitimately is a sim missing and the device is multi-sim. In that scenario the sim missing page would show and behave as seen in the wizard script. If the skip button is pressed it would jump to location settings and if a sim is inserted instead then it would go to the choose data sim activity. I would assume the same if two or more sims are inserted",
