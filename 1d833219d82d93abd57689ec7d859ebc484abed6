The point is that we don\u0027t do anything with subactivities in this class (we start no activity at all, it\u0027s merely a warning that may or may not show up), so it\u0027s all been circuitous for no reason. That\u0027s why I moved stuff into onCreate. No need to have it hop around like that. Unless I am missing something...?",
